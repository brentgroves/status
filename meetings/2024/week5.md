# Father's directions

The world's love is performance based, but my love is unconditional. The world's system promotes fear you must perform better than your neighbor.  I say help your neighbor and especially help the ones that are struggling. Do not worry about your own status.  Do not promote yourself instead think of others and help them in their work.

## **[API Gateways](https://callistaenterprise.se/blogg/teknik/2023/04/20/kong-api-gateway-part1/)**

An API Gateway is an architectural pattern which introduces a transparent placeholder between API clients and the APIs, where Cross Cutting Concerns such as Access Control, Monitoring, Logging, Caching and Rate Limiting can be implemented.

### Ingress to Kubernetes cluster

Kubernetes lives in a virtual network. To access k8s services from outside of the cluster:

- static IPs apart from any of the host IPs are used.
- K8s network interface uses the drivers of host NICs.
- Network packets sent to K8s IP/MAC addresses are forwarded to the Kubernetes API gateway for to be processed.

### Resolving MAC Address from IP Address in Linux

If you just want to find out the MAC address of a given IP address you can use the command arp to look it up, once you've pinged the system 1 time.

```bash
# Find mac address of reports1 load-balancer ip
# ping from reports-alb
ping -c1 10.1.0.8 
PING 10.1.0.8 (10.1.0.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 10.1.0.112 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable

--- 10.1.0.8 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 received, +1 errors, 100% packet loss, time 0ms
```

Now look up in the ARP table:

```bash
# Find mac address of reports1 load-balancer 
$ arp -a
reports13 (10.1.0.112) at 98:90:96:c3:f4:83 [ether] on enp0s25
reports1.busche-cnc.com (10.1.0.8) at 98:90:96:c3:f4:83 [ether] on enp0s25
```

## Install **[Kong API Gateway](../../k8s/kong-experimental-install.md)**

## K8s HTTP Routing examples

Incoming requests are matched against hostnames before the HTTPRoute rules are evaluated. If no hostname is specified, traffic is routed based on HTTPRoute rules and filters (optional).

```yaml
# The following example defines hostname "my.example.com":
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: httproute-example
spec:
  hostnames:
  - my.example.com
```

## Rules

Rules define semantics for matching an HTTP request based on conditions, optionally executing additional processing steps, and optionally forwarding the request to an API object.

## Matches

Matches define conditions used for matching an HTTP request. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched if any single match is satisfied.

Take the following matches configuration as an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
...
spec:
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        value: "/foo"
      headers:
      - name: "version"
        value: "2"
    - path:
        value: "/v2/foo"
```

## Key Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying that a requester has permissions to access a resource. API gateway authentication authenticates the flow of data to and from your upstream services.

Kong Gateway has a library of plugins that support the most widely used methods of API gateway **[authentication](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/#authentication)**.

Common authentication methods include:

- Key Authentication
- Basic Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 Authentication (Kong for free) <https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/oauth2/>
- LDAP Authentication Advanced
- OpenID Connect

Run kubectl get gateway kong -n default to get the IP address for the gateway and set that as the value for the variable PROXY_IP.

```bash
export PROXY_IP=$(kubectl get gateway kong -n default -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
echo $PROXY_IP
```

Test that the API is secure by sending a request using curl -i $PROXY_IP/echo. Observe that a HTTP 401 is returned with this message:

```bash
curl -i $PROXY_IP/echo
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Date: Fri, 05 Jan 2024 17:48:36 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Connection: keep-alive
WWW-Authenticate: Key realm="kong"
Content-Length: 96
X-Kong-Response-Latency: 1
Server: kong/3.5.0
X-Kong-Request-Id: 2e0dbd1ac29f85282b68067dc25f032e

{
  "message":"No API key found in request",
  "request_id":"2e0dbd1ac29f85282b68067dc25f032e"
}% 
```

## test http connection with API key

```bash
curl -H 'apikey: hello_world' $PROXY_IP/echo
Welcome, you are connected to node reports52.
Running on Pod echo-74c66b778-j2n45.
In namespace default.
With IP address 10.1.184.161.
```

## Rate limiting

## Test the rate-limiting plugin

To test the rate-limiting plugin, rapidly send six requests to $PROXY_IP/echo:

```bash
for i in `seq 6`; do curl -H 'apikey: hello_world' -sv $PROXY_IP/echo 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP"; done
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
```

This shows that the rate limiting plugin is preventing the request from reaching the upstream service.

## Test the proxy-cache plugin

To test the proxy-cache plugin, send another six requests to $PROXY_IP/echo:

```bash
for i in `seq 6`; do curl -H 'apikey: hello_world' -sv $PROXY_IP/echo 2>&1 | grep -E "(Status|< HTTP)"; done
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Cache-Status: Miss
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Cache-Status: Hit
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Cache-Status: Hit
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Cache-Status: Hit
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Cache-Status: Hit
< HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests

```

The first request results in X-Cache-Status: Miss. This means that the request is sent to the upstream service. The next four responses return X-Cache-Status: Hit which indicates that the request was served from a cache.

The X-Cache-Status header can return the following cache results:

| STATE   | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Miss    | The request could be satisfied in cache, but an entry for the resource was not found in cache, and the request was proxied upstream.               |
| Hit     | The request was satisfied and served from the cache.                                                                                               |
| Refresh | The resource was found in cache, but could not satisfy the request, due to Cache-Control behaviors or reaching its hard-coded cache_ttl threshold. |
| Bypass  | The request could not be satisfied from cache based on plugin configuration.                                                                       |

The final thing to note is that when a HTTP 429 request is returned by the rate-limit plugin, you do not see a X-Cache-Status header. This is because rate-limiting executes before proxy-cache. For more information, see **[plugin priority](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/custom-logic/#kong-plugins)**.

## Kong Ingress **[HTTPS Redirect](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/services/https-redirect/)**

Learn to configure the Kong Ingress Controller to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS so that all communication from the external world to your APIs and microservices is encrypted.

## Update HTTPRoute to use certificate

1. **[Create a certificate](../volumes/pki/gen-and-install-certs.md)** for the reports1.busche-cnc.com hostname.
2. Update your routing configuration to use this certificate.

## Add TLS configuration

The routing configuration can include a certificate to present when clients connect over HTTPS. This is not required, as Kong Gateway will serve a default certificate if it cannot find another, but including TLS configuration along with routing configuration is typical.

1. **[Create a certificate](../volumes/pki/gen-and-install-certs.md)** for the reports1.busche-cnc.com hostname.
2. Update your routing configuration to use this certificate.

```bash
kubectl patch --type json ingress echo -p='[{
    "op":"add",
 "path":"/spec/tls",
 "value":[{
        "hosts":["kong.example"],
  "secretName":"kong.example"
    }]
}]'
```

## Why **[OpenStack](https://microstack.run/)**

We have K8s clusters spanning 3 dell Optiplexes in both Avilla and Albion. So, if one machine breaks the cluster continues to run the report system on the other two.  We also have K8s clusters on various virtual machines on Nutanix and WMware vSphere hypervisors. If one of those virtual machines go down K8s maybe able to run the software on the other nodes but we have not tested this.  If we create an OpenStack cluster on three or more bare Dell R620s we can ensure the report system stays running even if one or more nodes goes down.

How OpenStack differs from other hypervisors is its API.  It is made to be automated and controlled by clients through it's API.

## service mesh vs. API gateway

Here are the key things to know about service mesh vs. API gateway:

- Service mesh acts as a centralized infrastructure layer for efficient microservices communication, simplifying tasks like service discovery and load balancing.
- API gateways, on the other hand, serves as the entry point for external clients to access microservices, managing functions like request routing and authentication.

## Introduction to Linux interfaces for **[virtual networking](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/10/22/introduction-to-linux-interfaces-for-virtual-networking)**

Linux has virtual networking capabilities that are used VMs and containers, as well as cloud environments. A list of interfaces can be obtained using the command ip link help.

```bash
ip link show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: enp0s25: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 18:03:73:1f:84:a4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: br-ef440bd353e1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default 
    link/ether 02:42:93:30:4c:99 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

    link/ether 02:42:91:90:d3:0d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

For other interfaces like tunnel, please see **[An introduction to Linux virtual interfaces: Tunnels](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/05/17/an-introduction-to-linux-virtual-interfaces-tunnels/)**

## Bridge

A Linux bridge behaves like a network switch. It forwards packets between interfaces that are connected to it. It's usually used for forwarding packets on routers, on gateways, or between VMs and network namespaces on a host. It also supports STP, VLAN filter, and multicast snooping.

![](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.png)

Use a bridge when you want to establish communication channels between VMs, containers, and your hosts.

### Here's how to create a bridge

```bash
# ip link add br0 type bridge
# ip link set eth0 master br0
# ip link set tap1 master br0
# ip link set tap2 master br0
# ip link set veth1 master br0
```

This creates a bridge device named br0 and sets two TAP devices (tap1, tap2), a VETH device (veth1), and a physical device (eth0) as its slaves, as shown in the diagram above.

## How to find the **[mac address](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/120153/resolving-mac-address-from-ip-address-in-linux)** to remote ip

## kubernetes Load balancer

I don't know how it works but it does not seem to use iproute2 utilities to add a second IP to the network interface.

### **[Multiple IP Address](https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/#how-to-use-multiple-addresses-on-a-single-interface)** per NIC

From **[article](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1432883/how-to-create-sub-interface)** with many examples **[here](https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/#how-to-use-multiple-addresses-on-a-single-interface)**:

At this fundamental level, aliases are supported by the Linux kernel. However, I believe the ability to create aliases for interfaces comes from older network configuration tools like ifconfig and route

Second, the iproute2 package and its utilities are the modern approach to network configuration. It allows assigning multiple addresses to an interface without the need for aliases.

Third, netplan, it is yet another new approach to configuring networks and interfaces, via yaml files.

Specific to your question, you will wind up defining different routes per IP address on your interface. Netplan DOES provide labeling of interfaces but I don't believe this is necessary for you to achieve your goals. (From the documentation)

```yaml
ethernets:
enp3s0:
  addresses:
    - 10.100.1.37/24
    - 10.100.1.38/24:
        label: "enp3s0:0"
    - 10.100.1.39/24:
        label: "enp3s0:some-label"
```

A **[SOCKs5 proxy server](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/socks-proxy-primer-what-is-socks5-and-why-should-you-use-it/)** creates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to another server behind the firewall on the client’s behalf, then exchanges network packets between the client and the actual server. The SOCKS proxy server doesn’t interpret the network traffic between client and server in any way; it is often used because clients are behind a firewall and are not permitted to establish TCP connections to outside servers unless they do it through the SOCKS proxy server. Therefore, a SOCKS proxy relays a user’s TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) session over a firewall.

SOCKS is a layer 5 protocol, and it doesn’t care about anything below that layer in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model — meaning you can’t use it to tunnel protocols operating below layer 5. This includes ping, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), etc. From a security perspective, it won’t allow attackers to perform scans using tools such as Nmap if they are scanning based on half-open connections because it works at layer 5.

![](https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/02/OSI-vs.-TCPIP-models.jpg.webp)

Since SOCKS sits at layer 5, between SSL (layer 7) and TCP/UDP (layer 4), it can handle several request types, including HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, SMTP, and FTP. As a result, SOCKS can be used for email, web browsing, peer-to-peer sharing, file transfers, and more.

Other proxies built for specific protocols at layer 7, such as an HTTP proxy that is used to interpret and forward HTTP or HTTPS traffic between client and server, are often referred to as application proxies.

There are only two versions: SOCKS4 and SOCKs5. The main differences between SOCKs5 and SOCKS4 are:

- SOCKS4 doesn’t support authentication, while SOCKs5 supports a variety of authentication methods; and
- SOCKS4 doesn’t support UDP proxies, while SOCKs5 does.

## What is Azure Bastion?

I do not believe Azure Bastion is a **[SOCKs5 proxy server](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/socks-proxy-primer-what-is-socks5-and-why-should-you-use-it/)** which we could use to create a secure TCP connection to our API Gateway. Instead, it is only usable to create a secure RDP/SSH connection to an on-premise server.

Is our Bastion host configured to provide SSH tunneling (Dynamic Port Forwarding) from an Azure Public IP to a VM or computer within our company's network, remote port forwarding, taking care of TLS termination?

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/media/connect-ip-address/ip-address.png)

<https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Bastion/Tasks/managingsessions.htm#managingsessions>

## **[Azure Bastion Native Client Support](https://codyburkard.com/blog/bastionabuse/)**

Instead of logging in through the Azure Portal, Azure Bastion now allows users to connect using their native RDP or SSH clients.

If so I believe Bastion can be setup to route traffic to our K8s-hosted API gateway which has its own routing, throttling, TLS termination, and IAM authentication and authorization scheme.

If TLS termination is done by our Bastion host then we will probably need to pay for a Public IP and a TLS certificate. Once this is done I believe we will be able to access our data warehouse reporting UI and micro-services from a Microsoft Teams reporting app.

Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service that you provision to securely connect to virtual machines via a private IP address. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly over TLS from the Azure portal, or via the native SSH or RDP client already installed on your local computer. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software.

Bastion provides secure RDP and SSH connectivity to all of the VMs in the virtual network for which it's provisioned. Using Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines from exposing RDP/SSH ports to the outside world, while still providing secure access using RDP/SSH.

The following diagram shows connections to virtual machines via a Bastion deployment that uses a Basic or Standard SKU.
