## **[Statistics Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_stat_intro.asp)**

Statistics is the science of analyzing, reviewing and conclude data.

Some basic statistical numbers include:

- Mean, median and mode
- Minimum and maximum value
- Percentiles
- Variance and Standard Devation
- Covariance and Correlation
- Probability distributions

The R language was developed by two statisticians. It has many built-in functionalities, in addition to libraries for the exact purpose of statistical analysis.

You will learn about these features, and how to use them in the next chapters.
