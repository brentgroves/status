## Meeting Summary

Talked to Aamir Ghaffar and Vishal Kumar Medavarapu

- Table, Index, SPROC requirements to Aamir
- Send email of PowerBI paginated (rdx) report to Vishal

## Report system

Why do we need a report system besides the one that comes standard with Plex?

- long running SPROCS time-out so complex queries on large data sets are not possible.
- Queries run against a snap shot of the database which can be several hours old so live reporting is not possible.
- Reports based on data from multiple datasources such as MSC tooling vending machine and Plex.

The reporting system is meant to give customers the ability to run reports using data residing in our data warehouses.  Rather than running reports from individual databases, we use ETL scripts to pull data into our data warehouses so that we can have all the data in one place. Non-ERP data sources include tooling inventory and usage data collected by our MSC vending machines and tool life data collected from UDP servers attached to our CNC.  The tool life data collection process was successfully created and tested but has not been put into production as of yet.  It will require a possible vlan for our Okuma CNC, Moxa UDP servers, and small network switches or multiplexors at each cell.
