# Father's directions to his son

I love you my son and nothing is going to change that.  Remember that nothing that you say or do will make me think poorly of you because you are the love of my life.  I am devoted to encouraging you in every situation.  I am going to help you through each problem.  We are going to enjoy each new day no matter what trouble we face we will overcome them together.  You are never alone.  When you are sick I am there.  When you are hurting I am there. Do not fear I am always with you because you are my son.  I won't let anything that is bad for you to happen.  Remember, there will be pain and sorrow in this life, but there will be renewal and growth as you endure each painful circumstance.  I have a reason for every trial that comes your way and each one has a purpose for your own good my son.

- Love
Dad

## Prepare for repsys meeting

Work on the **[webhooks](../../volumes/go/tutorials/webhook/webhook.md)** tutorial.

## Is IntelliPlex/Web Focus designed for data science tasks?

When you study data science the following software is mentioned alot:

Minitab, SPSS, PowerBI, R, Python

In traditional reporting managers look at dashboards to get an overview of the business.

In data science time series data is collected to make forcasts and answer questions.

We all have seen traditional dashboards so let's instead look at an example of how to use data science software.
 
## Continue R tutorial

launch R Studio using compose

```bash
pushd .
cd ~/src/repsys/docker/r
docker compose up

```

## IaaS

<https://kumul.us/what-is-openstack/>

OpenStack® is an open source software platform for private clouds and public clouds. As an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform, OpenStack enables companies to easily and efficiently add servers, storage and networking components to their cloud.

## PaaS

<https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-paas>

Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a form of cloud computing where an application software platform is provided by another party. Primarily for developers and programmers, a PaaS allows the user to develop, run, and manage their own apps without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform usually associated with the process.

PaaS platforms can run in the cloud or on on-premise infrastructure. For managed offerings, a PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure and delivers this platform to the user as an integrated solution, solution stack, or service through an internet connection.

For cloud-native development use cases, a Kubernetes-based PaaS can function as the platform on which container-based applications can run, scale, and be managed. For example, the cloud services editions of Red Hat® OpenShift®  are managed PaaS offerings.

## What is a Kubernetes PaaS?

<https://platform9.com/blog/kubernetes-paas-or-not-to-paas/>

In relation to Kubernetes, a PaaS would provide a simple way for developers to deploy containerized applications; point, click done.

In reality, a PaaS for Kubernetes would need to expose the secret sauce of Kubernetes in a simple way with a seamless deployment mechanism. Before jumping into the PaaS debate, it’s worth asking, is Kubernetes already a PaaS?

If we agree that it is not, then the challenge, or maybe the expectation, is presented well by Janakiram MSV in his blog on Kubernetes and PaaS
