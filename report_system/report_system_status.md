# Report System Status

This is a work in progress.  When finished we will have a Microsoft Teams tab accessible way to request, view, and archive both parameterized reports requiring long running SQL scripts and those requiring live Plex data. It will also be able to use the **[Azure Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview)** to email excel files or about anything else having to do with any Microsoft apps.

**[Power BI paginated reports (.rdl files)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/paginated-reports/parameters/report-builder-parameters)** with parameters.

Current Status:

- The Southfield Trial Balance report which is generated by Python ETL scripts and viewed from a Power BI paginated report accessible from a Microsoft Teams tab is online now. This report is needed because of an Plex issue isolated to certain PCN. This is the Plex recommended way of generating this important report for the affected PCN.  
- An internal Kubernetes cluster is hosting a MySQL database which is being used in tandem with our Azure SQL db.  Both the MySQL and Azure SQL databases perform the same function but the Azure SQL database is needed because it is secured by a Microsoft public IP and SSL certificate needed for Microsoft Teams apps.
- Our internal Kubernetes cluster can handle most tasks for the report system but since it is not publicly accessible we still need an Azure Kubernetes service for hosting the reports and apps which are to be accessible from Microsoft Teams tabs.
- The report system request, viewer, and archive app are not complete yet but the Kubernetes Cluster used to run the supporting software such a the MySQL, Redis, and the Kong API server is up and running.
