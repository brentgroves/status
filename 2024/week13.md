# Father's direction

My son you can not find peace in contentment in work.  My intentions for work is that it can be a time we can enjoy together and that you can enjoy helping others. Peace and contentment will come when you follow me as I guide you in what to say and do. All results for my work for you are in my hands. I may decide for you to wait on many things to teach you that work can not be a source of peace and contentment.

My son do not be anxious when there is so many things to do.  Instead look to us for guidance and we will help you with each task.  Remember we have a plan for you and we will be with you each step of the way so do not worry our son.

We have heard your prayer and will give you courage to face every trial, trouble, pain, and sorrow.  You will be able to endure each hardship because of the faith and hope that we have given you.  So do not fear and rejoice because along with the hardships you must face to learn what you must there will also be great wonders for you to explore with us and those around you!

I love you and will help you to have a loving heart!  I will give you courage and help you to bear each trial and endure every hardship my son.  Do not forget that you are part of a community and I want you to learn to love each person, creature, and even the land where you live.

The world's love is performance based, but my love is unconditional. The world's system promotes fear and says you must perform better than your neighbor.  I say help your neighbor and especially help the ones that are struggling. Do not worry about your own status.  Do not promote yourself instead think of others and help them in their work. Only in this way will you have perfect peace my beloved son.

```text
Good morning dear ones,
I hope you and your loved ones are doing well today and I value each one of you as friends who work together enjoying each others company as we get what needs done :-)  As always please feel free to call me at home or at work about anything you like!  

Sincerely yours,
Brent G.

## OAuth2 vs Legacy Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- Microsoft Identity Provider or Key Stone are examples of OAuth IAM
- Plex classic uses legacy identity management
  
### Legacy IAM 
- relies on system accounts which is user account with escalated premissions.
- system accounts are created by the IT staff and their passwords can change
- Plex classic has system accounts that can be used to access SOAP web services which can do most anything in Plex
 
### OAuth IAM
- Has clients which are the apps with claims which are the permissions they have.
- Clients are registered with the IAM provider by the developer
- Certificates or secrets are used in the identification process
- Claim permissions are consented to by Admins
- ID and Access tokens can be requested by clients for different purposes by many types of OAuth flows. 
-  Microsoft uses OAuth IAM to access its graph API which can also be used to do most anything pertaining to any of their M365 apps.

## Microsoft 365 developers account

I was fortunate enough to get into this program which is closed now.  If you would like to test something in Azure just ask me and I will give you access.

## Report Requestor App Chain

- rs_teams: collect customer requests and status
- rs_etl: runs etl scripts
- rs_store: stores result set with id and params in the object database.
- rs_excel: creates excel
- rs_move: Move Excel to one drive and s3 storage
- rs_mail: send email with one drive link

## [Microsoft Graph](https://dzone.com/articles/getting-access-token-for-microsoft-graph-using-oau)**

Microsoft Graph is here to unite Azure and Office 365 data under a single roof. It is a simple REST API and Microsoft provided many examples of how to use it, including an interactive Graph Explorer which allows us to discover the different methods.

## Microsoft Graph Access Token App

- Responsible for getting and refreshing the msgraph repsys access token.
- Publishes current msgraph access token to cache database.
- Other apps subscribe to cache database msgraph_access_token.  
  
## Azure MIS resources

- **[M365 E5 license](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/e5?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)** includes Power BI Pro. Have it for Mobex and have Linamar contact.  
- **[Visual Studio Subscriptions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/)** Anyone with this subscription can create our source code repos. Would like one of these since have lots of repos and am always adding ssh keys to repos.
- Create a series of small REST apps.
  - get an access token using the credential flow.
  - get a user profile using OIDC authentication.
  - send email with one drive links to Excel files.
- Created fork of **[Postman Microsoft Graph collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-postman)** for testing and practice.
- Practiced Azure app registration from the command line
- Tested sending email from my developer's tenant.
- Determine the minimum permissions necessary to send email with the Azure app.
- Practice getting admin consent for these apps.
- **[Create a message with a file attachment and send the message using Golang](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-sendmail?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=go#example-3-create-a-message-with-a-file-attachment-and-send-the-message)**

## OAuth2 Authentication/Authorization Summary

- OIDC/PKCE Authentication Flow works with HTTP Get/Post requests
- OAuth2 Authorization Flow with HTTP Get/Post requests works fine with Office 365 work accounts but is beyond me for Office 365 personal accounts. We were able to retrieve an access token from the Graph Explorer that will work with HTTP Get/Post requests for even Office 365 personal account.

## Notes

- You can use a basic Office 365 account from an Azure account but it is considered an external user not in the tenant so when registering an app you must use the common not tenant endpoints and allow all organizations to access them.

## Plan

The goal is to get Azure resource costs to be approximately $500 per month. Also to request a resource group named "repsys" in which the user "<bGroves@linamar.com>" is assigned the "Contributor" role.

- Access the Azure Portal
- Send Mail with Graph API or smtp
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scenario-daemon-overview>
- create Azure SQL database
Your administrator has disabled the App registration experience in the Azure portal. You can still register or manage applications using PowerShell or another client such as Visual Studio.

- Create an Excel file showing the estimated monthly cost of all Azure resources.
- Contact IT and IS team to gather any resource needs I may be unaware of.
- Back up our Azure SQL work and data warehouse database schemas to an on-premise SQL Server 2022 running in a Docker container.
- Create a bash script and the Azure CLI to create all Azure resources.
- research ip6 addresses and subnet for k8s and OpenStack.
- Conduct meetings as needed with Brent H. Amir, Jarod, and Kevin.

## To do

- **[HTMX GoLang OAuth2/OIDC Login](https://github.com/Darkness4/auth-htmx)** or **[login page example](https://medium.com/@hhartleyjs/making-a-login-page-with-htmx-go-5acbcc504426)**

- SQL Table variable example.
- Research HTTP and TCP using GoLang libraries
- Research OAuth2 and OIDC using Github and Azure Identity Platforms.
- Research HTMX to create SPA.
- Go web app in AKS and teams
- azgraph API using certificate
- rsdw on reports5 in k8s
- add Azure app registration code to az CLI bash script
- Install OpenStack/K8s cluster on 3 R620s
- Would IP6 be better than IP4 for multi-site VPN

## SQL Stack

- Machine Language - numbers represent instruction

``` machine_code
8A1E0A00                mov bl, [10]
```

- Assembly Language - words represent machine instructions

```masm
   #make_COM#
   include 'emu8086.inc'
   ORG 100h
   MOV AL, 1
   MOV BL, 2
   PRINTN 'Hello World!'   ; macro.
   MOV CL, 3
   PRINTN 'Welcome!'       ; macro.
   RET
```

- General Purpose Language - commands such as while loop that represent multiple assembly language instructions.

![](https://www.sqlshack.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sampletable-image.png)

```sql

USE tempdb
GO
 
DECLARE @Counter INT , @MaxId INT, 
        @CountryName NVARCHAR(100)
SELECT @Counter = min(Id) , @MaxId = max(Id) 
FROM SampleTable
 
WHILE(@Counter IS NOT NULL
      AND @Counter <= @MaxId)
BEGIN
   SELECT @CountryName = CountryName
   FROM SampleTable WHERE Id = @Counter
    
   PRINT CONVERT(VARCHAR,@Counter) + '. country name is ' + @CountryName  
   SET @Counter  = @Counter  + 1        
END
  ```

  ![](https://www.sqlshack.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/reading-table-records-with-sql-while-loop.png)

- SQL - Concise while loop syntax in the form of select columns and join tables.
- SQL group - Select statement that groups and orders records.
- SQL window functions - More concise multiple grouping of records called partitions.

Example: When we partition records into serial_no and order by change date and lag by 1 the previous record in the partition could have the same location.  If we partition by serial_no and location when we lag by 1 the previous record will have a different location. This partion will group represent every same location change record as just 1 record and we loose the fact that a container could move to a location more than once in its history.

## What is OpenStack

It is a clusterable hypervisor which can be driven by an API.

## What is a hypervisor?

It is multiple software components each focused on the virtualization of singular hardware resource such as memory, storage, cpu, network port working together to create and manage virtual machines.

## Repsys OpenStack

3 dell r620s with 192 GB ram and 10 network ports each linked together to form a programmatically controlled hypervisor.

## HTMX

<https://htmx.org/>

htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext

htmx is small (~14k min.gz’d), dependency-free, extendable, IE11 compatible & has reduced code base sizes by 67% when compared with react

### motivation

- Why should only `<a> & <form>` be able to make HTTP requests?
- Why should only click & submit events trigger them?
- Why should only GET & POST methods be available?
- Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?
By removing these constraints, htmx completes HTML as a hypertext

## Repsys Notes

- Divide our Azure SQL Managed Instance into two databases: Azure SQL Db for the Data Warehouse and an On-Prem MSSQL ETL database.
- Run the ETL database on On-Prem K8s
- Every that was in the Azure SQL Managed Instance is now in the ETL database but it has not been deployed to K8s yet.
- Currently the Azure SQL Db has only the TB result set
- Power BI reports will connect to the new Data Warehouse
- Repsys Portal to accept report requests and view export all reports.

## Protocol details

The OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow is described in section 4.1 of the OAuth 2.0 specification. Apps using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow acquire an access_token to include in requests to resources protected by the Microsoft identity platform (typically APIs). Apps can also request new ID and access tokens for previously authenticated entities by using a refresh mechanism.

## Try **[running this request in Postman](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/f77994d794bab767596d)**

Try executing this request and more in Postman -- don't forget to replace tokens and IDs!
