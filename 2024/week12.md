# Father's direction

We have heard your prayer and will give you courage to face every trial, trouble, pain, and sorrow.  You will be able to endure each hardship because of the faith and hope that we have given you.  So do not fear and rejoice because along with the hardships you must face to learn what you must there will also be great wonders for you to explore with us and those around you!

I love you and will help you to have a loving heart!  I will give you courage and help you to bear each trial and endure every hardship my son.  Do not forget that you are part of a community and I want you to learn to love each person, creature, and even the land where you live.

The world's love is performance based, but my love is unconditional. The world's system promotes fear and says you must perform better than your neighbor.  I say help your neighbor and especially help the ones that are struggling. Do not worry about your own status.  Do not promote yourself instead think of others and help them in their work.

Good morning dear ones,

I hope you and your loved ones are doing ok and that the time change has not upset your sleep schedules to much!  Please feel free to contact me at home or work about anything.  I enjoy working with each of you very much :-)

Sincerely yours,
Brent G.

## Plan

The goal is to get Azure resource costs to be approximately $500 per month. Also to request a resource group named "repsys" in which the user "<bGroves@linamar.com>" is assigned the "Contributor" role.

- Create an Excel file showing the estimated monthly cost of all Azure resources.
- Contact IT and IS team to gather any resource needs I may be unaware of.
- Back up our Azure SQL work and data warehouse database schemas to an  on-premise SQL Server 2022 running in a Docker container.
- Create a bash script and the Azure CLI to create all Azure resources.
- research ip6 addresses and subnet for k8s and OpenStack.
- Conduct meetings as-needed with Brent H. Amir, Jarod, and Kevin.

## To do

- **[HTMX GoLang OAuth2/OIDC Login](https://github.com/Darkness4/auth-htmx)**
- SQL Table variable example.
- Research HTTP and TCP using GoLang libraries
- Research OAuth2 and OIDC using Github and Azure Identity Platforms.
- Research HTMX to create SPA.
- Go web app in aks and teams
- azgraph api using certificate
- rsdw on reports5 in k8s
- add Azure app registration code to az CLI bash script
- Install OpenStack/K8s cluster on 3 R620s
- Would IP6 be better than IP4 for multi-site VPN

## SQL Stack

- Machine Language - numbers represent instruction

``` machine_code
8A1E0A00                mov bl, [10]
```

- Assembly Language - words represent machine instructions

```masm
   #make_COM#
   include 'emu8086.inc'
   ORG 100h
   MOV AL, 1
   MOV BL, 2
   PRINTN 'Hello World!'   ; macro.
   MOV CL, 3
   PRINTN 'Welcome!'       ; macro.
   RET
```

- General Purpose Language - commands such as while loop that represent multiple assembly language instructions.

```sql

USE tempdb
GO
 
DECLARE @Counter INT , @MaxId INT, 
        @CountryName NVARCHAR(100)
SELECT @Counter = min(Id) , @MaxId = max(Id) 
FROM SampleTable
 
WHILE(@Counter IS NOT NULL
      AND @Counter <= @MaxId)
BEGIN
   SELECT @CountryName = CountryName
   FROM SampleTable WHERE Id = @Counter
    
   PRINT CONVERT(VARCHAR,@Counter) + '. country name is ' + @CountryName  
   SET @Counter  = @Counter  + 1        
END
  ```

  ![](https://www.sqlshack.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/reading-table-records-with-sql-while-loop.png)

- SQL - Concise while loop syntax in the form of select columns and join tables.
- SQL group - Select statement that groups and orders records.
- SQL window functions - More concise multiple grouping of records called partitions.

Example: When we partition records into serial_no and order by change date and lag by 1 the previous record in the partition could have the same location.  If we partition by serial_no and location when we lag by 1 the previous record will have a different location. This partion will group represent every same location change record as just 1 record and we loose the fact that a container could move to a location more than once in its history.

## What is OpenStack

It is an API for a hypervisor.

## What is a hypervisor?

It is multiple software components each focused on the virtualization of singular hardware resource such as memory, storage, cpu, network port working together to create and manage virtual machines.

## Repsys OpenStack

3 dell r620s with 192 GB ram and 10 network ports each linked together to form a programmatically controlled hypervisor.

## HTMX

<https://htmx.org/>

htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext

htmx is small (~14k min.gzâ€™d), dependency-free, extendable, IE11 compatible & has reduced code base sizes by 67% when compared with react

### motivation

- Why should only `<a> & <form>` be able to make HTTP requests?
- Why should only click & submit events trigger them?
- Why should only GET & POST methods be available?
- Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?
By removing these constraints, htmx completes HTML as a hypertext

## Repsys Notes

- Divide our Azure SQL Managed Instance into two databases: Azure SQL Db for the Data Warehouse and an On-Prem MSSQL ETL database.
- Run the ETL database on On-Prem K8s
- Every that was in the Azure SQL Managed Instance is now in the ETL database but it has not been deployed to K8s yet.
- Currently the Azure SQL Db has only the TB result set
- Power BI reports will connect to the new Data Warehouse
- Repsys Portal to accept report requests and view export all reports.

## Azure repsys resource creation script

az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'

## Backup / Restore Azure SQL MI

- Can not use sqlpackage to do this.

## Power BI Report Server

On-premises reporting with **[Power BI Report Server](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/report-server/)**

**[How to embed a Power BI report in a web app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-embed-secure)**
Licensing
To view the embedded report, you need either a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license. Or, the content needs to be in a workspace that's in a Power BI Premium capacity (EM or P SKU).

## Protocol details

The OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow is described in section 4.1 of the OAuth 2.0 specification. Apps using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow acquire an access_token to include in requests to resources protected by the Microsoft identity platform (typically APIs). Apps can also request new ID and access tokens for previously authenticated entities by using a refresh mechanism.

## Try **[running this request in Postman](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/f77994d794bab767596d)**

Try executing this request and more in Postman -- don't forget to replace tokens and IDs!

This diagram shows a high-level view of the authentication flow:
