# Father's direction

I love you and will help you to have a loving heart!  I will give you courage and help you to bear each trial and endure every hardship my son.  Do not forget that you are part of a community and I want you to learn to love each person, creature, and even the land where you live.

The world's love is performance based, but my love is unconditional. The world's system promotes fear and says you must perform better than your neighbor.  I say help your neighbor and especially help the ones that are struggling. Do not worry about your own status.  Do not promote yourself instead think of others and help them in their work.

Beyond RDBMS
Modern application development has several challenges. From selecting a “stack” of front-end through data storage and processing from several competing standards, through ensuring the highest levels of security and performance, developers are required to ensure the application scales and performs well and is supportable on multiple platforms. Using Azure SQL Database Hyperscale together with your favorite combination of .NET, Python and Node, all running in a Kubernetes cluster, it is easy to create a highly scalable solution with the Microsoft Azure platform. Using Kubernetes means developers have the flexibility of using local environments for a seamless and consistent deployment of your application. Azure SQL Database Hyperscale provides a scalable, highly resilient, and secure environment for data storage and processing.

With data API builder, database objects can be securely exposed via REST or GraphQL endpoints so that your data can be accessed using modern techniques on any platform, any language, any device. With an integrated and flexible policy engine, granular security is assured; integrated with Azure SQL it gives developers an efficiency boost like never seen before.

RAG (Retrieval Augmentation Generation) is a technique that enhances the LLM’s ability to produce relevant and informative responses by retrieving additional data from external sources. SQL Database Hyperscale integration with Azure Cognitive Search allows developers to create an Azure OpenAI Service model. Applications built on SQL can ask questions about their data using the trained Azure OpenAI Service model. It also provides the database platform for building AI ready applications through close integration with Open AI , Azure Open AI, and Azure AI Search services. Building cloud native database applications has never been easier.
