# Father's will

Fear not my son.  I love you and am always with you.  It is me that controls every situation you face. Remember that every trouble that you go through is for your ultimate good. You must not stay as you are. There are things you must learn and the only way for that to happen is for you and I to face hardships together.  So do not fear when you face trials for this is necessary in order for you to grow into a kind and loving man full of hope in my love for you!
