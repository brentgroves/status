## What is **[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/software/)**

OpenStack is a an open source cloud operating system managing compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter using APIs.

**[OpenStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack)** is a free, open standard cloud computing platform. It is mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service in both public and private clouds where virtual servers and other resources are made available to users.

Three out of four government IT professionals in a new poll say their agencies are now using cloud computing services. The new survey also found that a significant portion of the respondents have favorable perceptions about the cost, security and ease of deploying the popular open source software platform, OpenStack, for their on-premises cloud computing initiatives.

How Governments Use **[OpenStack](https://vexxhost.com/blog/how-governments-use-openstack-around-the-world/
)
Governments all over the world have important priorities. Keep their citizens safe, keep law and order within their jurisdiction, and problem solve any issues that arise are just some of the issues that they face on a day to day basis. Although the way that they govern their countries the following countries have one thing in common: OpenStack.

**The United States Of America**
In the United States, the National Security Agency (NSA) utilizes the power of OpenStack to keep abreast of the high-security needs of the country. The implementation of OpenStack at the governmental level was such a success that the NSA plan on implementing OpenStack to all 16 agencies that make up the intelligence community in the United States. Considering the emphasis that the United States place on security, it is evident that OpenStack delivers where it matters most.

Moreover, the role of OpenStack in government security for the United States is good for OpenStack users. Why? Because the NSA has such strong security requirements, it developed systems to accommodate these requirements. From securing APIs and guest OSes to developing code to suit their needs, the OpenStack community can experience the security benefits for themselves.
