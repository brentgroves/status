## Schema-Driven Development

In GraphQL your API starts with a schema that defines all your types, queries and mutations, It helps others to understand your API. So itâ€™s like a contract between server and the client. Whenever you need to add a new capability to a GraphQL API you must redefine schema file and then implement that part in your code. GraphQL has its Schema Definition Language for this purpose. gqlgen is a Go library for building GraphQL servers and has a nice feature that generates code based on your schema definition.

## GraphQL

Attempt to use GraphQL to call stored procedures.

## Why **[OpenStack](https://microstack.run/)**

We have K8s clusters spanning 3 dell Optiplexes in both Avilla and Albion. So, if one machine breaks the cluster continues to run the report system on the other two.  We also have K8s clusters on various virtual machines on Nutanix and WMware vSphere hypervisors. If one of those virtual machines go down K8s maybe able to run the software on the other nodes but we have not tested this.  If we create an OpenStack cluster on three or more bare Dell R620s we can ensure the report system stays running even if one or more nodes goes down.

How OpenStack differs from other hypervisors is its API.  It is made to be automated and controlled by clients through it's API.
