## Schema-Driven Development

In GraphQL your API starts with a schema that defines all your types, queries and mutations, It helps others to understand your API. So itâ€™s like a contract between server and the client. Whenever you need to add a new capability to a GraphQL API you must redefine schema file and then implement that part in your code. GraphQL has its Schema Definition Language for this purpose. gqlgen is a Go library for building GraphQL servers and has a nice feature that generates code based on your schema definition.
