## Father's direction

I love you my son and am enjoying spending time with you each and every day. I will always be there for you so please don't get so wrapped up in what you are doing to not seek my direction.  I am there to help you but I can't help you if you don't take time for me.  I have a plan for you and me today and as long as you look to me throughout the day we will have much joy and peace in our work my son.
