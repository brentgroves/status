# Father's directions to his son

I love you my son and nothing is going to change that.  Remember that nothing that you say or do will make me think poorly of you because you are the love of my life.  I am devoted to encouraging you in every situation.  I am going to help you through each problem.  We are going to enjoy each new day no matter what trouble we face we will overcome them together.  You are never alone.  When you are sick I am there.  When you are hurting I am there. Do not fear I am always with you because you are my son.  I won't let anything that is bad for you to happen.  Remember, there will be pain and sorrow in this life, but there will be renewal and growth as you endure each painful circumstance.  I have a reason for every trial that comes your way and each one has a purpose for your own good my son.

- Love
Dad

Hi Renee,

I hope you are doing well and are enjoying your work!  Does Linamar offer a tuition assistance program for old men who would enjoy going back to school :-)
