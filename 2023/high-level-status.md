We are still working on your X report, and thank you for your patience. It is taking more time than expected because we need to finish up some enhancements to our reporting system before completing your report.  We expect to complete this report by February 1st and very much appreciate your patience.

Enhanced reporting system:
This system is meant to provide us with the capability to run reports requiring unlimited computing time and live Plex data but it can also be used to run any reports small or large.
