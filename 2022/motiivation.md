Please guide me this day Father in doing good deeds and helping others.
Happy Thanksgiving my friends,
During this holiday season, I have been listening to and observing people and thinking about our troubles while examining my own heart.  While doing these things I have been inspired to write some thoughts down that I would like to share with my friends. If these thoughts are too embarrassing for your sensibilities I apologize for this, my intention though is that in some small way will these thoughts may help us to grow feelings of contentment, peace of mind, and even some joy in living in this sometimes scary world ðŸ™‚

What motivates us and keeps you going?

Short impossible list:
Making an incandescent light bulb.
Going to the moon.
Making a self-driving car.
Making a cybernetic limb.
And maybe the most difficult caring for someone that hurts you.

We seemed fascinated by trying to do these seemingly impossible tasks.  This is attested to by the great number of popular movies we enjoy watching such as Rudy, Astronaut Farmer, Hidden Figures, October Sky, and the list goes on.

Too many questions:
Why do we attempt to do things that are hard? Is it for the very reason that they are difficult, challenging, or seemingly impossible to accomplish? What strange creatures we are if this is the case. What then prevents us from at least attempting to do such great things? Is it a maybe fear of failure or something else? Why then should we even attempt to do these difficult and seemingly impossible things? Maybe the reason to keep trying to do these hard things is so that we have something to strive for and some purpose in life that keeps us going.

One thing for sure is that if we don't attempt these difficult, challenging, and seemingly impossible tasks they will never come to pass, but even if our attempts don't pan on the same scale as the incandescent light bulb does that mean it is better not to try? Maybe the main reason to work toward seemingly impossible goals is that we have something in the back of our heads that helps us to endure the drudgery of everyday life.  

Ok, I admit we should not just be a dreamer because there are many things in this life that simply have to get done, and we don't want to be a burden to others who might have to take up the slack of doing the work we have chosen not to do, but if we don't at least take some time to accomplish the things that we desire and dream about what then will keep us contented and on the right track to being happy and a blessing to others. I have no answers here and am mostly just thinking out loud, some might say rambling on ðŸ™‚, but maybe for the sake of our own well-being and happiness, which hopefully will rub off on others and be an encouragement to them also, it might be a good idea to spend at least some time focusing on and working towards accomplishing those seemingly impossible dreams that help to keep our spirits up, happy, and sometimes even excited about living.

Sincerely your friend
